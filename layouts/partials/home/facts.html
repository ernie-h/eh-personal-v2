			Here, you will learn about my skills, projects and journey as a software engineer.
			I've been coding since my high school years and have developed a great respect for software through my studies, peers, and coworkers.
			I've been fortunate enough to have done multiple co-ops, where I've received amazing mentorships from some great engineers.
			If you are the curious type, I also have a blog where you can explore my interests, reflections, and travel stories.
