For my second co-op, I had the opportunity to work as a Software Engineer Co-op for Placepass, one of the leading tech startups in downtown Boston. During my second year I had met with the VP of Operations at a co-op fair and chatted about what PlacePass had to offer the world. He explained that PlacePass’ mission was two-fold:  to provide the best travel experiences on a seamless platform and experiences that enrich their customers’ lives. Long story short, I was hooked; not only to the passion of the team, but to the vision that they believed would disrupt the travel industry. 
My first interview had been in the basement of a leased house in Harvard Square. I remember seeing engineers, customer service operators, and executive team members all bunched up side by side, collectively working to meet oncoming deadlines and OKRs. After completing my first engineering interview in the basement of the Trowbridge house, I had not been successful due to my lack of experience and knowledge of web development. Though I was slightly disappointed, I understood the decision and took my passion to America’s Test Kitchen (ATK), a famous food network company located at Seaport. My time at ATK propelled my learning on how modern-day companies built web applications and the thought that was put into all areas of the tech stack. ATK had groomed me into an eager Software Engineer, hungry to learn and ready to challenge.

My second round of interviews had come nearly a year later when I had sent a blind email to the VP of Operations, hoping he had remembered the passionate kid from the co-op fair. He did. This time I was called to interview at PlacePass’ new office in Downtown Crossing. Just in one year, PlacePass had already secured their series B funding and moved to one of Boston’s largest tech hubs, an incredible testament to the speed of startup expansion. I was even more excited than before. Having had a year to hone my skills and expand my experience, I was finally accepted and ready to prove myself.

## Working at PlacePass
On my first day, I was welcomed by a pair of blue and green balloons tied to my office chair, followed by an assortment of swag, including company stickers, a luggage tag, a portable toothbrush, and a new space-black Apple laptop. Since I had joined, PlacePass was still figuring out what company it wanted to be and the culture it wanted to instill in its employees. One thing was for certain; PlacePass placed a huge emphasis on making employees feel welcome and at home. Daily foosball tournaments were hosted in the cafeteria during lunch and delicious catered food was provided every Wednesday, ranging from Hawaiian poké bowls to Brazilian barbecue chicken. ‘Lunch and Learns’ were also hosted on Wednesdays and were a way for all members of the organization (30 employees during my time) to learn what various departments were working on. Whether it was the executive team closing a funding deal with a potential partner or the Director of Engineering explaining how we would transform our current services, the company was open and transparent to all employees about its affairs. The spread-out office space and free seating only complemented this goal and it wouldn’t be an uncommon sight to see a co-op (like me) go on a coffee break with the company’s CEO/Co-founder.

For the first couple months, I had been given tickets related to our partnerships with corporate behemoths in the travel space, such as Marriott, Marriot Vacations Worldwide (MVW), Hertz, and Southwest. Since my main experience had been with front-end frameworks such as React and Ruby on Rails, I decided powering through UI tickets would be a great starting point for me to get a trickle-down grasp of the full tech stack. A sprint was measured at 2 weeks long, with a total amount of estimated points to be completed by the end of it. These points were allocated to various tickets, ranging from UI, API, and data work, which were coordinated during sprint planning. Every morning at ten o’clock, the engineering and product teams would have a fifteen-minute standup meeting discussing current tickets in the pipeline as well as any ad hoc requests that flowed through from partners.

 After the first couple months, I had already been very well acquainted with the UI codebase and flew through tickets. My co-workers were always free to lend a helping hand and the documentation provided was easy to follow. My supervisor and other engineers were quick to notice my contributions and I was trusted with a few projects of my own, such as rewriting our sites’ search bar auto-complete, implementing international currency selection, improving our internal tooling, such as adding Typescript linting and improving our front-end build tools, and being part of a squad of senior engineers tasked with a complete rebuild of our car rental products. Having big responsibilities that a full-time engineer would take on was an amazing affirmation to me that I was doing good work and that Computer Science was a field I could excel in.
Another great thing about the engineering team was how accommodating they were for me to branch out to different parts of the stack and learn what I was interested in. Having done a lot of front-end projects, I expressed to the Director of Engineering that I wanted to do more work related to the API and data layer. I was given smaller tickets related to these areas which allowed me to get set up with a series of SpringBoot Java services, local Mongo databases, and access to our AWS accounts. Not only that but the Director of Engineering himself had offered to stay after hours to personally walk me through some cutting-edge tech, such as Rust, Go, JAM Stack sties, and a lot more. Additionally, setting up 30-minute meetings with other senior engineers to pick their brains on their interests, such as machine learning with TensorFlow or data indexing with ElasticSearch, was as easy as marking their calendar and sending an invite. The value that many of the senior engineers saw in me and the genuine care they put into molding me had greatly impacted my view on software and the quality of work I aimed to achieve.

## Personal Development
After my co-op ended it was bitter sweet to leave PlacePass. I had been through an incredible journey, from my first meeting over two years ago at the co-op fair to my integral role as a Software Engineer, I was leaving with invaluable experiences I wouldn’t have found anywhere else. I learnt how important it was to always be persistent and not to take current realities as permanent. When I didn’t make my first interview, I was disappointed and slightly mad at myself, but it had just not been my time yet. I came back the next year smarter, faster and better, and I landed the job. It was also eye-opening to see how hardworking and self-motivated many of the engineers were. Observing how they worked and the hours of outside work they put into their learning to stay ahead of the curve was inspirational. It showed me that learning didn’t just end after the 9-5 or inside the classroom, rather it was a constant pursuit that I had to find the time and motivation to nurture. I am incredibly thankful for my time at PlacePass and will likely return as a full-time Software Engineer after graduation.
