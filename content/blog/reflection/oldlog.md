So I had read a medium article (surprise, surprise) where this person had kept a coding journal for 100 consecutive days. Given that around this time I was just being introduced to some awesome industry technologies, like React and Springboot, I wanted to log my experience and keep track of my progress. A 100 days of coding was ambitious, I know, but I had made it to day 59, and looking back at am qutie entertained by the content. Have a look, and especially at the progression of quality in my logging :)

<!-- ## This is my CODING log baby :fire: -->

## Day 1: 28th June, 2018

#### **Thoughts:**
Worked on customizing my terminal for optimal use. Read up on bash/zsh profiles.
Hoping to get back my git aliases from work: `git cut` `git stat` `git co` `git fpd`
Learned some markdown and have a post on dev.to in progress. Get ready for some
fire fonts :smirk:. I want to start building my site, but also read this article about
object detection using a python library. Im thinking of warming up with some react
practice tomorrow, then move onto the python stuff :smile:.

#### **Blockers:**
Will procrastinate if I play 2k or Fortnite. Better force myself to exit my man cave.
Not being employed is a hard life. Honestly kind of threw me off my cycle from working
a 9-5 job. This is where the discipline and thirst for learning has to kick in.
I want to be good at coding and understanding the dynamics of this field. I learnt
so much at ATK not because I was forced to, but because I had a habit that put me
in the mindset to. I must leave my place in order to progress because my place
is a den of distraction.
Stay tuned :radio:

#### **Goals for TMR:**
- Setup basic layout of my site, with a title, image, header and description
- Checkout python library for object detection and see if I can get it working.

**7/10** Did good research and learnt things.

## Day 2: 29th June, 2018
#### **Thoughts:**
Was only able to do minimal work, trying to file sort my react website. Added git
aliases and switched back to bash using `bash-it`.

#### **Blockers:**
Distractions. No time during day to work. Forced myself to do something code related
which was good.

#### **Goals for TMR:**
N/A

**3/10** Did a bit and forced myself to think code no matter how small.

## Day 3: 30th June, 2018
#### **Thoughts:**
Didn't do any coding. Was distracted. Yay I did only 2 days of coding for the
100 days of code challenge. I think I needed a break though, because I'm going to
be in Web development during the summer, and that will require me to code way
more than 2 hours a day.

#### **Blockers:**
I didn't code. Got distracted.

#### **Goals for TMR:**
N/A

**0/10** No coding.

## Day 4: 1st July, 2018
#### **Thoughts:**
Didn't code today. Tomorrow I begin my classes and along with that Web Dev.
I got an air-conditioner though :fan:!

#### **Blockers:**
Its hot and i'm not coding.

#### **Goals for TMR:**
- Start strong in my classes and get ahead (especially web dev)
- Begin to code everyday now. Contributions everyday

**1/10** for thinking ahead

## Day 5: 2nd July, 2018
#### **Thoughts:**
Beginning of Web Dev and man is there a lot of work. I finished setting up a
lot of my environment including JDK, maven, mongodb, node.js, heroku, etc.
Excited for this class as a lot of it is relevant to what I want to get better at.
AKA Web dev, react, JS. LETS DO THIS BABY :fire:

None so far, im motivated.

#### **Goals for TMR:**
- Finish setting up environment

**7/10**

## Day 6: 3rd July, 2018
#### **Thoughts:**
Set up a lot of my env. Worked on different templates (login, register, user-admin).
Webapps on heroku and locally work which is great. Just time to start implementing
more html elements/styling. Got most of the first parts of my assignment done.
Ready to start diving in.

#### **Blockers:**
None so far ... might need to balance a bit with personal life and work.

#### **Goals for TMR:**
- Finish up templates
- Start working on Database and getting some controllers done

**7/10**

## Day 7: 4th July, 2018 :fireworks:

Didn't really understand too much of what was going on.

#### **Goals for TMR:**
- Continue with assignment
- Continue with hard work
9/10

## Day 8: 5th July, 2018
#### **Thoughts:**
Try to put in as much work as I can before Rhode Island. Stuck on understanding how to implement data base connection with Java persistence. Stuck.

#### **Blockers:**
First time working with database connection, confused.

9/10

## Day 12: 9th July, 2018 :happy:
#### **Thoughts:**
Went to TA office hours and realized that `mvn clean install` was a command I could use to test that my spring boot app was packaging correctly. My JPA connection was working fine, it was just packaging my jar which was holding me back. After recompiling the jar, delete/edit/create user all worked. Started working a bit on register.

#### **Blockers:**
- Stress
- lack of sleep

#### **Goals for TMR:**
- Get register done
- Get login done
9/10

## Day 13: 10th July, 2018 :happy:

#### **Thoughts:**
Got session to work first thing in the morning. Was a simple casting error on java-server side with Optional<User>, with User being returned as either null or an actual user. Simple get around by assigning it as a User and doing a null check instead of using the Optional cast. Worked on styling and learnt a lot more about Bootstrap. Jumbatron class is op. Learnt how to make responsive components with `class=container/container-fluid`. Finally submitted this shiz. :poop:

#### **Blockers:**

4/10

#### **Goals for TMR:**
- Get modules to render/connect with db
8/10

## Day 19: 16th July, 2018
#### **Thoughts:**
Definitely stressed. Did a lot of work getting Modules to render with data like courselist. Haven't done too much on lessons. Complained/asked a lot on piazza.
#### **Blockers:**
- A lotta work
#### **Goals for TMR:**
- Get Lessons to work 8/10

## Day 20: 17th July, 2018
#### **Thoughts:**
COMPLETED LESSONS. Im pretty close and Im really getting the hand with React, especially with state, lifecycle methods, and props passing to children. The active tab click function was probably the highlight of today.

#### **Goals for TMR:**
- Get the update functionality to work
- Put in course create dates and modified dates for courses

8/10

## Day 21: 18th July, 2018
#### **Thoughts:**
I am the Hokage :ninja: I pushed our due date to Thursday, however, I still have a lot of styling/kinks to workout. Lesson content is rendering, however, the component is not being removed after navigating to a separate module. Need to debug a lot of state, because sometimes links don't render when they have to. Jose helped quite a bit with lifecycle methods.
#### **Blockers:**
- Components are flashy
- Rendering is off
#### **Goals for TMR:**
- Fix flashy rendering
7/10

## Day 22: 19th July, 2018
#### **Thoughts:**
Our prayers have been heard, and the due date is now moved to Monday. Now I can take a much needed break only after I fix the strange rendering. Learned redux in class. Spent time debugging flashy rendering with lifecycle methods and added a condition in `componentDidUpdate` function.
#### **Blockers:**
- Styling
- Should I do topics?
#### **Goals for TMR:**
FAMILY'S COMING. Gonna spend time with them. :fireworks:
8/10

## Day 23: 20th July, 2018

Woke up early and biked to the Westin to hang with fam. Brought them to Steph's for brunch, walked around Newbury, and showed them my place. Was able to do some work at Snell after my group project. Not much.
#### **Blockers:**
- Styling/buggy routing
#### **Goals for TMR:**
- Work out some kinks
- Do more Styling
5/10

## Day 24: 21st July, 2018
#### **Thoughts:**
Today I finally figured out why my Routing was off. I had to wrap the `<Router/>` component around the parent `index.js`, instead of declaring them randomly around components. That solved all my issues and the app works fine. Made quite a bit of progress with styling, secondary/dark colors.
#### **Blockers:**
None
#### **Goals for TMR:**
- Going to work on styling a lot
- Add topics
8/10

## Day 25: 22nd July, 2018
#### **Thoughts:**
Worked on implementing Topics. Completely migrated Lessons service/client to Topics. Unable to solve CORS problem. Re-vamped site into dark mode. Really beautiful. Instead of table view for courselist, now it is a card deck.

#### **Blockers:**
- None
#### **Goals for TMR:**
- Figure out why Topics can't connect to server
- Last touches on Styling

7/10

## Day 26: 23rd July, 2018
#### **Thoughts:**
I missed a `/topic` on my Java server side URL, god danggg it. Small typo. Also called the `lessonService` instance instead of `topicService` for a fetch method. Touched up styling

#### **Goals for TMR:**
- Get started on Redux assignment

## Day 27: 24th July, 2018

## Day 45 to 54: 12th - 21st August, 2018
#### **Thoughts:**
One of the most stressful weeks of my life. During this week I had done a lot to finish our group project Kooker.
Designed  95% of the UI using Material UI and Bootstrap for column/row spacing. Studied at Snell for 12 hours straight
for 3 days in a row, but have no regrets on how hard I worked. I still need to get a tattoo reminding me how far I've come.
Ended up earing a 94.5% on my WebDev project and an A in the class, while I got a B in Marketing. There was an obvious imbalance 
on the time I dedicated to each subject, but I'm glad I acheived such a high grade in Webdev. It showed that I really do have
the apitude for the field. I can learn marketing anytime I want huehuehue.

## Day 55 to 58: 22nd - 24th August, 2018
#### **Thoughts:**
Cameron visited my stressed out ass. I had just finished all my exams and came down from an incredibly stressful week.
It was great to see him again and destress. We explored a lot of Boston, mostly by bike, going to North End, BU, Allston,
Cambrdige, Harvard Square, Harvard, the Charles River, MIT, Boston Commons, and Chinatown. Got him and myself really fuked up too.
Took :mushroom: for the first time and realized how beautiful the world was. Till Ezoo :giraffe:

## Day 59: 25th August, 2018
#### **Thoughts:**
Today Cameron left and I had to wake up at 9:00 to help him do the laundry, anything for you my man.
After I went back to sleep and went to Masa in South End for brunch with babe. We then trekked to a nearby
Starbucks and worked for a couple hours. I was able to purchase the domain name **www.erniehao.com** from Google,
and redirect **erniehao.com** to my static site hosted by AWS s3. Got the site to work, and the general layout figured out.
Just need to get the content.
#### **Blockers:**
- None
#### **Goals for TMR:**
- Finish the about page with the layout I planned
- Get started on skills/goals
