The time was 5:40 PM and an Asian male had just exited a state library in a Western country.

The library was located a few blocks south from a local college and a single block west from a predominantly Chinese neighborhood, also known as the country’s Chinatown.

As the Asian male was finding his bearings, a sedan had pulled up a few steps in front of him, and to his surprise was manned by four albino chimps. A Caucasian male had walked by and exchanged glances with the Asian male, both acknowledging the sudden disruption in peace.

The albino chimps were loud, their screeches echoing throughout the block whilst waiting impatiently on red to turn green. After a loud bang on the dashboard, the albino chimp sitting shotgun had made eye contact with the Asian male and stirred up with an uncontrollable excitement.

“Niiii haooo” it screamed obnoxiously.

The Asian male pondered the greeting for a moment. Ni Hao was the Chinese greeting for Hello, which would have made sense to the Asian male if he were Chinese, but it was complicated. The Asian male was actually Cantonese and grew up in Hong Kong, where the word for Hello was Lei Hou, but it was complicated. The Asian male didn’t speak Chinese or Cantonese and natively spoke English with a Western accent. Ni Hao or Lei Hou weren’t phrases he used frequently unless to extended relatives and locals. But how was the albino chimp to know such a rich cultural history when its only lens was an Asian male in a predominantly Chinese neighborhood, called Chinatown?

“Hello there!”, the Asian male replied with graceful English as he retraced his thought process.

The albino chimp paused as if his primitive brain had failed to process the exchange that had happened. To the chimp this was an Asian male in a Chinese neighborhood called Chinatown, which meant that he would only talk in Chinese. The chimp had yet to see an Asian male in a Chinese neighborhood, called Chinatown ever fully understand its tongue fluently yet alone respond fluently. The chimp was perplexed and could only cope with a bashful cackle and a muttered Ni hao to itself, as if a second time round would prove his reality.
