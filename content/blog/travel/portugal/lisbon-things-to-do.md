This summer my girlfriend and I had planned a Eurotrip across four different countries. The first leg of the trip was arrviing in Lisbon; one of Portugal's most historic and ancient cities. Portugal is the western-most European country with a relatively dry climate and strong sun presence, atleast during the summer. Here are some tips, locations, and advice I would like to give while travelling to Lisbon, Portugal.

## ACCOMADATION
Where should you live? Lisbon is hilly and damn slippery. If you are planning to be close to the city center find somewhere close to **Rossio Station**, Lisbon's train station center. Stayling close to here will put you equidistant to most attractions, whether thats climbing further up the city or strolling towards the coast, this is a good spot to stay at. Also make sure it is close to station and at the same level. We had stayed a block above the station and had to lug our suitcases a couple stories and let me tell you that it is not fun. Also keep in mind if you are 

## TRANSPORTATION

If you're staying around Rossio Station or a few blocks away, most places are easy to reach on foot, which is the beauty of Lisbon. Albeit there will be hills to climb, but that is also part of the beauty. Train is actually quite efficient. It's easy to grab from the airport and end up in the city with only two transfers. Easy to get around in too. Trams are easilly accessible too and can be hopped on to where ever it passes through, but can be crowded and limited with its lines. There also seems to be an **electric bike/scooter** initiative in Lisbon and those seem really fun and efficient to travel in.

## LOCAL ETIQUETTE

Most Portuguese locals in Lisbon were quite nice, but they were also quite direct. If you are going to a busy shop or restaurant, be sure to know what you want ahead of time and order fast as they can be quite direct with you. Also we noticed this in Lisbon, but being Asian (can't speak on behalf of other races) be prepared for the occassional stares and __ni haos__ they throw at you, and try not to take too much offense. I know I did and it ain't worth it.

## TOURIST DENSITY / PROTECTION
4/5

During peak tourist season, Lisbon didn't have as many tourists as Florence or Barcelona, but still a decent chunk. Most tourists were from the States and not too many from Asia.
