Porto is a beautiful city jam-packed with things to do and sights to see. Since Porto is a coastal city located in Northern Portugal, it tends to have a cooler climate than the country's capital, Lisbon. Full of life, friendly people, and hearty food, Porto is a must-see city when stopping by Portugal. Here are things I would've liked to know before traveling to this beautiful city.

## ACCOMODATION
1. *Baixa*
We stayed in Baixa and personally loved it. It is the main downtown area that provides central access to many of Porto's major sights such as the Praca da Liberdade (historical city square), Clerigos Tower (tallest tower and church), Rua de Santa Catarina (main shopping street), and much more! 

2. Ribeira
Ribeira Square is Porto's riverside square that has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is extremely beautiful, bustling with restaurants, shops, and wine bars. Along the Douro river you can see a view of the famous double-deck bridge that connects Ribeira to Vila Nova de Gaia (below).

3. Vila Nova de Gaia
Calling all wine lovers -- here is your dream location. Vila Nova de Gaia is on the opposite side of the Duoro river from downtown Porto, however is bustling with a surplus port wineries. Porto is famous for its port wine production and so a wine tasting or wine tour (consider Douro Valley below) is essential! Stay here if you want easy access to some good port wine ðŸ˜‰

## TRANSPORTATION

Porto itself is a relatively small city, such that if you wanted to walk straight across the city you could probably do so within 20-30 minutes. However, one thing to keep in mind that it is *extremely* hilly. Thus, if traveling with a person with mobility issues, it may be ideal to live near a train station. Additionally, Uber is available in Porto, or you may opt for traditional taxis as well.

*Sao Bento Train Station* is the main train station that provides access to regional trains across Porto. It is also a very picturesque station lined with ceramic tiles and tourists posing for photos. Go for it! 

We took a train from Lisbon to Porto and it took roughly 3 hours, with trains running every hour or so. However, I highly advise to buy your tickets *in advance*. We waited to purchase our tickets at the Lisboa station and were met with a long queue to purchase, and sold out train times. We ended up taking a train 4 hours later than we had hoped. Don't be us.

Another thing to note is that there is a young person discount (25% off for persons under 25), a senior citizen discount (50% off), and a return trip ticket discount if purchased in advance (10% off). These discounts will usually automatically apply or you may be comfortable chipping in the fact that you qualify. A nice perk, and also may impact your choice of travel between cities.
