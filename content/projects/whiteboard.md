# WORK IN PROGRESS

In the late Summer of 2018, I had decided to take a class that would forever change the way I viewed industry software. Up till then, I had a very academic view of computer science: ddknowledge of various algorithms and data structures, but not a solid footing on practical applicatons. Taking *Web Development*, a CS elective offered to undergrads and graduates, had opened my eyes to the amazing field and the modern day framewoks that were used by many individuals.

**Whiteboard** was a cumalative project that each student was required to build over a span of six weekly assignments. The general deliverables were highlighted in each assignment, but the design, bonus questions, and extra features students wanted to implement were differentiating and often times rewarding factors. I believe my implementation of Whiteboard had been exceptional and the learning process eye-opening, which is what I hope to show in this project reflection.
