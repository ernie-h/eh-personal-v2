TorchTales brings back fond memories of my last high school years and the onset of my interest in tech. Back then I had known ```nil``` about programming. All I had was a raw passion to create and learn, with the limited knowledge I possessed.

In my high school, all graduating seniors were required to complete a senior project that would be their culminating assignment on anything they wanted. I wanted to create a mobile game of my high school administration, which would feature inside jokes and possibly controversial jabs at school policies at the time. I asked two of my peers, Matt and Nicole, good friends and future computer science undergrads to join me. They were excited.

## PROCESS & DELEGATION

{{< figure src="/img/projects/torchtales/process.png" alt="process hero" title="Our three main objectives laid out for our mobile application (Jan 2016)">}}

Having a vision of our product was awesome. It inspired us on what we could accomplish and a legacy we could leave behind. However, we needed tangible delievarables and proper delegation of strengths to get there. The **Mechanics** of the game were vital. How was the player going to interact with the game? What tech stack were we going to use to develop this app? The **Design** was focused on providing a user-friendly interface to our users. How would we create the graphics? **Marketing** was focused on the branding and legality of our game. How were we going to get on the app store? How would our school community discover this game?

## MECHANICS

Matt primarily took charge of the mechanics of the game as he had some mobile development experience in Swift. We had tried to develop with XCode, but quickly found that it was beyond our abilities with the current time frame. We looked for alternatives we could use and qucikly found a drag-n-drop game builder called GameSalad. It that handled all the game building boilerplate, such as physics and animations, and compliled down to iOS and Android friendly applications.

## DESIGN

I took charge of design as I had experience with Photoshop and had a more complete vision of what the game would look like. I wanted it to be a retro pixel art platform game that would instill a feeling of nostalgia of the old flash or Super Mario games, many of us used to play as kids. I had loaded up Photoshop and set the initial sprite sizes to be 16x16, then started filling in each pixel and seeing what would be made. There were many iterations, but as I got better, it was evident that our game's assets would be quite polished!

## MARKETING

Nicole took charge of the marketing and legality of our application. Having formerly interned at a law firms tech team, she was excited to take on the role and get our app out into the public. She had quickly put together a site with Wix and secured a domain for our company name, __**Swfit Cup'O Java**__, which was based on the tech stack we intended to use. We then set up a facebook page and invited our whole High School community to the page and started a campaign with subsequent ads prior to our launch. Nicole was also in charge of exploring the viability of getting our game on the iOS app store before our deadline.
