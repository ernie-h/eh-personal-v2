## Standin sub-heading 1.
P1: The past months have seen Hong Kong, a hub of global commerce, paralyzed by city-wide protests. What started as opposition to a bill that would allow the extradition of of accused criminals to mainland China, the protest movement has become a platform for other grievances: among them demands for universal suffrage, accountability for alleged government corruption, and the resignation of Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, the city's chief executive. As tensions between protesters and the government have heightened, clashes between the police and protesters have become increasingly violent and the societal rift has frozen some of Hong Kong's most reliable institutions and establishments.

P2: The extradition bill crisis, the most significant in Hong Kong since pro-Communist party agitation for revolution against the British colonial government in 1967, has been marked by demonstrations and protests from the city's business districts and the government's headquarters to residential neighborhoods far from the city-center. On August 5, Hong Kong experienced its first general strike --- illegal under the city's standing labor laws --- in more than 50 years. Rare demonstrations by the city's civil servants, legal associations, and medical professionals have underscored the city's dissatisfaction with the government's handling of the recent social upheaval.

P3: The extradition legislation which sparked months of civil disquiet was first drafted in the Legislative Council in February following the killing of Poon Hiu-Wing in early 2018. Hong Kong resident Chan Tong-kai had murdered his girlfriend while on vacation in Taiwan before fleeing to Hong Kong. The proposed mechanism would allow for the extradition of accused criminals not only to the Republic of China in Taiwan, but also the People's Republic of China on the mainland and Macau, Hong Kong's sister Special Administrative Region. Many in Hong Kong and overseas were concerned about the proposed bill's applicability to foreigners transiting through the city and mainland China's tarnished human rights record. In light of deteriorating civil liberties in Hong Kong since the 2014 Umbrella Movement, some worried that the new extradition legislation would be used by Beijing to target pro-democracy activists in a substantive threat to the "One Country, Two Systems" paradigm that has kept Hong Kong's institutions separate from the mainland's since 1997.

P4: Protests, which began as largely peaceful marches, have often turned violent. In pitched battles taking place in city streets against pro-democracy protesters, police have fired more than 1,800 cannisters of tear gas and hundreds more rubber bullets, bean-bag rounds and sponge grenades. Amid the escalating violence, international bodies and governments have voiced their concerns about the use of force, particularly by authorities. Then-UK Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt announced on June 25 that licenses to export non-lethal crowd-control equipment to the Hong Kong Police Force would be suspended until the Foreign Office was satisfied that concerns about human rights and "fundamental freedoms" were addressed. After weeks of violent clashes between protesters and police, the United Nations Human Rights Office criticized police for flouting international norms and using weapons and equipment in a way that created a "considerable risk of death or serious injury."
